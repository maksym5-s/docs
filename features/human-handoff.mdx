description: "Seamless live transfer from AI agents to human operators when complex assistance is needed"

## Overview

While Recepta.ai's intelligent voice agents handle the majority of customer interactions autonomously, we understand that some situations require the human touch. Our Human Handoff feature provides seamless live transfer capabilities, ensuring your customers always receive the best possible service when AI assistance reaches its limits.

## How Human Handoff Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Escalation Trigger">
    The AI agent identifies situations requiring human assistance through various triggers:
    - Complex technical issues beyond knowledge base
    - Customer frustration or dissatisfaction
    - Requests for manager or supervisor
    - Situations requiring human empathy or judgment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preparation & Context">
    Before transferring, the AI agent:
    - Summarizes the conversation for the human agent
    - Collects all relevant customer information
    - Identifies the specific reason for escalation
    - Prepares handoff documentation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live Transfer">
    The system performs a warm transfer:
    - Human agent receives full context
    - Customer is smoothly transitioned
    - AI agent provides introduction if needed
    - Call continues without interruption
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human Interaction">
    Human agent takes over with:
    - Complete conversation history
    - Customer profile and preferences
    - Previous interaction records
    - Specific escalation reason
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Escalation Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
The AI agent automatically escalates calls when it detects:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complex Technical Issues" icon="tools">
    - Problems not covered in the knowledge base
    - Multi-step troubleshooting requirements
    - Integration or system configuration issues
    - Technical questions requiring specialist knowledge
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Frustration" icon="face-frown">
    - Negative sentiment detection
    - Repeated failed attempts to resolve issues
    - Customer expressing dissatisfaction
    - Requests to "speak to a human"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Policy & Authority Requests" icon="user-tie">
    - Requests to speak with a manager
    - Policy exceptions or special cases
    - Billing disputes or refund requests
    - Complaints requiring management attention
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sensitive Situations" icon="heart">
    - Emergency situations
    - Personal or emotional issues
    - Grief or distress situations
    - Cases requiring human empathy
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Manual Triggers
Human agents can also be reached through:
- **Customer Request**: Direct request to speak with a human
- **Keyword Detection**: Specific phrases like "human", "representative", "manager"
- **Agent Uncertainty**: When AI confidence levels drop below threshold
- **Business Hours**: Outside hours escalation to on-call support

## Configuration Options

### Escalation Rules
Configure when and how escalations occur:

```javascript
// Example escalation configuration
{
  "escalation_triggers": {
    "sentiment_threshold": -0.5,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
    "keywords": ["human", "manager", "supervisor", "complaint"],
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "frustration_indicators": ["repeat", "angry", "upset"]
  },
  "business_rules": {
    "automatic_escalation": true,
    "escalation_delay": 5,
    "context_summary": true,
    "warm_transfer": true
  }
}
```

  "authentication": "bearer_token",
  "data_format": "json",
  "include_recording": true,
  "include_transcript": true
}
```

## Best Practices

### Training Human Agents
Ensure your human agents are prepared:

<Tip>
  **Quick Onboarding**: Human agents should be able to quickly understand the context and continue the conversation naturally.
</Tip>

- **Context Review**: Train agents to quickly scan conversation summaries
- **System Familiarity**: Ensure agents understand your AI agent capabilities
- **Escalation Protocols**: Clear procedures for different escalation types
- **Customer Handoff**: Smooth transition techniques and language

### Optimizing Escalation Rules
Fine-tune your escalation settings:

- **Monitor Patterns**: Track common escalation reasons
- **Adjust Thresholds**: Optimize confidence and sentiment triggers
- **Update Knowledge Base**: Reduce escalations by improving AI knowledge
- **Feedback Loop**: Use human agent feedback to improve AI responses

### Customer Experience
Maintain service quality during transfers:

- **Transparent Communication**: Clearly explain the transfer process
- **Minimize Wait Time**: Keep transfer delays short
- **Preserve Context**: Ensure no information is lost
- **Follow-up**: Confirm resolution after human interaction
