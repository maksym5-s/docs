## Overview

The platform provides a comprehensive knowledge base system that allows you to train your AI agents with business-specific information from multiple sources including files, websites, and text content.

## Knowledge Base Creation

### Multi-Source Content Support
Based on the platform implementation, knowledge bases support:
- **File Upload**: Documents and files for content extraction
- **Website URLs**: Automatic content crawling and indexing
- **Text Content**: Direct text input for knowledge entries
- **Mixed Sources**: Combine different content types in single knowledge base

### Knowledge Base Configuration
- **Named Knowledge Bases**: Create multiple knowledge bases with descriptive names
- **Description Field**: Document the purpose and content of each knowledge base
- **Agent Assignment**: Connect specific knowledge bases to individual agents
- **Content Organization**: Structured approach to information management

## Content Management

### Source Management
The system provides tools for managing knowledge sources:
- **Add Sources**: Include new content from files, URLs, or text
- **Edit Sources**: Modify existing content and sources
- **Remove Sources**: Delete outdated or unnecessary content
- **Source Status**: Track processing and availability of content

### Content Processing
- **Automatic Processing**: Uploaded content is automatically processed and indexed
- **Content Indexing**: Information is organized for quick agent access
- **Search Optimization**: Content is optimized for agent query responses
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes to knowledge bases immediately affect agent responses

## Agent Integration

### Knowledge Assignment
- **Agent Linking**: Assign knowledge bases to specific AI agents
- **Multiple Assignments**: Single knowledge base can be used by multiple agents
- **Selective Assignment**: Choose which knowledge bases each agent accesses
- **Dynamic Updates**: Knowledge changes automatically propagate to assigned agents

### Response Enhancement
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Agents use knowledge base content to provide accurate answers
- **Source Attribution**: Agents can reference specific knowledge sources
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Agents have access to all assigned knowledge content
- **Real-time Access**: Agents query knowledge bases during live conversations

## Knowledge Base Management

### Creation Workflow
Based on the platform interface:
1. **Create Knowledge Base**: Set up new knowledge base with name and description
2. **Add Content Sources**: Upload files, add URLs, or input text content
3. **Assign to Agents**: Connect knowledge base to specific agents
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track how effectively agents use the knowledge

### Management Interface
- **Knowledge Base Listing**: View all created knowledge bases
- **Content Overview**: See sources and content within each knowledge base
- **Agent Assignments**: Track which agents are using each knowledge base
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor knowledge base utilization and effectiveness

## Content Types and Sources

### Supported File Types
The system processes various document formats:
- **Text Documents**: Plain text files and formatted documents
- **Web Content**: HTML pages and website content
- **Structured Data**: Organized information and databases
- **Custom Formats**: Platform-specific content types

### URL Processing
- **Website Crawling**: Automatic extraction of website content
- **Content Validation**: Ensure accessible and relevant content
- **Update Monitoring**: Track changes to web-based sources
- **Link Management**: Maintain and validate URL sources

## Knowledge Base Analytics

### Usage Tracking
- **Query Frequency**: Monitor which knowledge content is accessed most
- **Agent Performance**: Track how knowledge bases improve agent responses
- **Content Effectiveness**: Identify most valuable knowledge sources
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure comprehensive topic coverage

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Content Gaps**: Identify areas where additional knowledge is needed
- **Redundancy Detection**: Find overlapping or duplicate content
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure knowledge base impact on call quality
- **Update Requirements**: Track when content needs refreshing

## Integration with Agent System

### Automatic Synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Knowledge changes immediately available to agents
- **Configuration Integration**: Knowledge bases work with agent configuration system
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Single knowledge base can enhance multiple agents
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensure all agents have access to latest information

### Response Quality
- **Accurate Information**: Agents provide responses based on current business knowledge
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access to all relevant business information
