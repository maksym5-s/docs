## Configuring Call Forwarding in Google Voice

Google Voice's interface may change over time. For the most current instructions, we recommend consulting Google Voice's official documentation.

### Basic Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Google Voice Settings">
    Log into your Google Voice account and access Settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Call Forwarding">
    Find the call forwarding or linked numbers section (typically under "Calls" menu)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Recepta AI Number">
    Add your Recepta AI phone number as a forwarding destination

    Follow Google's verification process to confirm the number
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Other Devices">
    **Critical**: Ensure that all other devices are switched off in your Google Voice Settings

    <Warning>
    Your Recepta AI number should be the ONLY enabled forwarding destination. Otherwise, calls may ring multiple devices.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Save your settings and verify the configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Setup">
    Make a test call to verify calls are routing correctly to your Recepta AI voice agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Google Voice allows you to link multiple phone numbers. For best results with Recepta AI, disable all other linked devices and only enable forwarding to your Recepta AI number.
</Tip>

## Important Google Voice Limitations

### Sequential Ringing Not Natively Supported

<Warning>
Google Voice does not natively support ringing your personal cell phone for 5-8 seconds before forwarding to Recepta AI.
</Warning>

If you want this functionality, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Direct Forwarding (Recommended)

Simply forward all Google Voice calls directly to Recepta AI. This ensures:
- Instant call pickup
- No caller waiting time
- Most reliable configuration
- No missed calls

#### Option 2: Carrier Conditional Forwarding (Advanced)

Use a workaround with your cell phone carrier's conditional call forwarding:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Forward Google Voice to Cell">
    Configure Google Voice to forward all calls to your cell phone
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Carrier Forwarding">
    Configure conditional call forwarding with your cell carrier:
    - Forward on busy: To Recepta AI
    - Forward on no answer: To Recepta AI (after 5-8 seconds)

    Contact your carrier for specific dial codes and setup instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Both Scenarios">
    Test when you answer and when you don't to verify proper behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Conditional call forwarding availability varies by carrier. Not all carriers support this feature.
</Note>

  - Simplest configuration
  - Most reliable
  - Works with all carriers
  - No complex workarounds needed

  **Considerations**:
  - No personal screening option

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Carrier Conditional Forwarding (Advanced)">
  **Best for**: Users who want personal screening and have compatible carriers

  **Setup**: Google Voice → Cell Phone → (Conditional) → Recepta AI

  **Benefits**:
  - Option for personal pickup
  - AI handles missed calls
  - Flexible coverage

  **Considerations**:
  - Requires carrier support

## Device Management in Google Voice

### Disabling Other Devices

For Recepta AI to reliably receive calls, you must disable other forwarding destinations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Calls Settings">
    In Google Voice, go to Settings → Calls
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Linked Numbers">
    Find the section showing all linked phone numbers and devices
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable All Except Recepta AI">
    Turn off all devices/numbers except your Recepta AI forwarding number
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    Confirm that only Recepta AI number is enabled
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If multiple devices are enabled, Google Voice may ring them all simultaneously or in sequence, potentially preventing Recepta AI from answering calls reliably.
</Warning>

---

## Important Configuration Tips

### Preventing Infinite Call Loops

<Warning>
**Avoid Infinite Loops**: If your Recepta AI agent has you as a transfer destination, the transfer number **must be different** from your main Google Voice number. Otherwise, calls will get stuck in an infinite loop.
</Warning>

**Safe Configuration Example**:
- Google Voice Number: Forwards to Recepta AI → ✅ Correct
- AI Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone → ✅ Correct
- ❌ **WRONG**: AI transfers back to Google Voice number (creates loop)

**Why This Matters**:
If calls forward from Google Voice → Recepta AI → back to Google Voice, they'll loop forever, creating a poor customer experience.

### Google Voice Voicemail Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Voicemail Settings">
    In Google Voice Settings, find voicemail options
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust or Disable Voicemail">
    Consider disabling voicemail or extending the ring time before voicemail

    This ensures Recepta AI has time to answer before Google Voice voicemail triggers
  </Step>
</Steps>
