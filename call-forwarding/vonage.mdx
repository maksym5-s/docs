## Call Forwarding Strategies

Choose the strategy that best fits your business needs:

<Accordion title="Direct Forwarding (24/7 AI Coverage)">
  **Best for**: Businesses wanting complete AI automation

  - Reduced operational costs
  - Instant call pickup
  - Predictable customer experience
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sequential Routing (Personal Line First, AI Backup)">
  **Best for**: Professionals who want to screen calls personally

  **Setup**: Ring your personal cell phone for 5-8 seconds, then forward to Recepta.ai if unanswered

  **Benefits**:
  - Option for personal pickup
  - AI handles missed calls
  - No calls go to voicemail
  - Flexible coverage

  <Warning>
  Keep ring times under 10 seconds maximum. Many callers will hang up if they wait too long before reaching someone.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Business Hours Based (Time-Sensitive Routing)">

</Accordion>

## Important Configuration Tips

### Ring Time Management

<Warning>
**Critical**: Do not allow more than 10 seconds ring time before forwarding to Recepta.ai.

Many callers will hang up if they wait too long, defeating the purpose of having AI coverage.
</Warning>

If you choose to ring your personal cell phone before falling back to Recepta.ai:

- **Maximum Ring Time**: 5-8 seconds (10 seconds absolute maximum)
- **Sequential Mode**: Ensure phones ring one after another, not simultaneously
- **Caller Experience**: Minimize wait time for better caller retention
- **Test Thoroughly**: Make multiple test calls to verify timing

**Why Ring Time Matters**:
- 0-5 seconds: Excellent caller retention
- 5-10 seconds: Good caller retention
- 10-15 seconds: Significant caller drop-off
- 15+ seconds: High abandonment rate

### Preventing Infinite Call Loops

<Warning>
**Avoid Infinite Loops**: If your Recepta.ai agent has you as a transfer destination, the transfer number **must be different** from your main Vonage number. Otherwise, calls will get stuck in an infinite loop.
</Warning>

**Safe Configuration Example**:
- Main Vonage Number: Forwards to Recepta.ai → ✅ Correct
- AI Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone → ✅ Correct
- ❌ **WRONG**: AI transfers back to main Vonage number (creates loop)

**Why This Matters**:
If calls forward from Vonage → Recepta.ai → back to Vonage, they'll loop forever, creating:
- Poor customer experience
- Potential service charges
- System overload
- Frustrated callers who hang up

## Alternative: Cell Phone Carrier Forwarding

If you want Vonage calls to ring your cell phone for 5-8 seconds before falling back to Recepta.ai, you can use your cell phone carrier's conditional call forwarding feature.

### Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Forward Vonage to Cell">
    Configure Vonage to forward all calls to your cell phone
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Carrier Forwarding">
    Set up conditional call forwarding with your cell phone carrier:
    - Forward on busy: To Recepta.ai
    - Forward on no answer: To Recepta.ai (after 5-8 seconds)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Both Scenarios">
    Test when you answer and when you don't answer to verify proper behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Conditional call forwarding availability and setup vary by carrier. Contact your cell phone carrier for specific instructions.
</Note>

## Testing Your Configuration

Thorough testing ensures your setup works correctly in all scenarios:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Basic Forwarding">
    Call your Vonage number to verify it forwards to Recepta.ai
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Business Hours">
    If configured, test during and outside business hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Sequential Routing">
    If using sequential routing, verify proper fallback timing
  </Step>

    Verify AI agent transfers work without creating loops
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test From Multiple Numbers">
    Call from different phone numbers to test various scenarios
  </Step>

    Check logs in both Vonage and Recepta.ai dashboards
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls Not Reaching Recepta.ai">
    **Diagnostic Steps**:
    - Verify correct Recepta.ai phone number is entered in Vonage
    - Check that call forwarding is enabled and active
    - Ensure your Recepta.ai agent is configured and active
    - Review Vonage's call routing settings
    - Make test call and review logs in both systems

    **Common Causes**:
    - Typo in Recepta.ai phone number
    - Forwarding not activated
    - Conflicting call handling rules
    - AI agent not active or misconfigured
    - Vonage service issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calls Going to Voicemail">
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce ring time before forwarding (max 10 seconds)
    - Ensure Recepta.ai is set as primary forwarding destination
    - Disable or extend voicemail delay in Vonage settings
    - Check that forwarding rule takes precedence over voicemail
    - Verify forwarding is active 24/7 (if desired)

    **Best Practice**:
    Set ring time to 5-8 seconds to ensure AI pickup before voicemail triggers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infinite Call Loops">
    **Solutions**:
    - Use different phone numbers for transfers
    - Never forward Vonage number to itself
    - Configure AI transfers to direct lines (cell/desk phones)
    - Review complete call flow logic
    - Document your routing to avoid loops

    **Example Safe Setup**:
    ```
    Caller → Vonage Main → Recepta.ai → Transfer to Cell Phone
    (Each step uses a different number)
    ```

    **Warning Signs of a Loop**:
    - Calls disconnect automatically after ringing
    - Unusual call duration patterns in logs
    - Multiple entries for the same call
    - Callers reporting being "bounced around"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Long Wait Times">
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce sequential ring time to 5-8 seconds maximum
    - Eliminate unnecessary routing steps
    - Consider direct forwarding to AI
    - Remove simultaneous ringing (use sequential)
    - Test and optimize ring duration

    **Impact**:
    Research shows every additional second of wait time increases caller abandonment rate significantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Forwarding Not Working">
    **Solutions**:
    - Contact your cell phone carrier for support
    - Verify conditional forwarding is supported on your plan
    - Check forwarding codes are entered correctly
    - Test both "busy" and "no answer" scenarios
    - Consider using direct Vonage forwarding instead
