    Access your Talkroute account and navigate to settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Forwarding Number">
    Add your Recepta.ai phone number as a forwarding destination. Follow Talkroute's guidance on adding a forwarding phone number to your:

## Important Configuration Tips

### Critical Settings Checklist

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Disable Voicemail" icon="voicemail">
    **Must Do**: Uncheck "Enable Call Announcement & Talkroute Voicemail"

    Otherwise calls will go to voicemail instead of Recepta.ai
  </Card>

  <Card title="Caller ID Forwarding" icon="id-card">
    **Enable**: Configure incoming caller ID forwarding

    Allows your AI agent to see and announce who's calling
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ring Time Limits" icon="clock">
    **Maximum 10 seconds**: Ring time before forwarding

    Longer wait times increase caller abandonment rates
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="vial">
    **Make test calls**: After configuration

    Verify calls route correctly in all scenarios
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Preventing Infinite Call Loops

<Warning>
**Avoid Infinite Loops**: If your Recepta.ai agent has you as a transfer destination, the transfer number **must be different** from your main Talkroute number.
</Warning>

**Safe Configuration Example**:
- Main Talkroute Number: Forwards to Recepta.ai → ✅ Correct
- AI Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone → ✅ Correct
- ❌ **WRONG**: AI transfers back to main Talkroute number (creates loop)

## Testing Your Configuration

Thorough testing ensures your setup works correctly in all scenarios:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Basic Forwarding">
    Call your Talkroute number to verify it forwards to Recepta.ai
  </Step>

    Verify that caller ID information is being passed to Recepta.ai
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Business Hours">
    If configured, test during and outside business hours
  </Step>

    Check logs in both Talkroute and Recepta.ai dashboards

## Troubleshooting

    **This is the most common issue** with Talkroute setup.
