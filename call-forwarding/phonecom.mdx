## Call Forwarding Strategies

Choose the strategy that best fits your business needs:

<Accordion title="Direct Forwarding (24/7 AI Coverage)">
  **Best for**: Businesses wanting complete AI automation

  **Setup**: Forward all calls directly to Recepta AI phone number

  **Benefits**:
  - No missed calls
  - Consistent service 24/7
  - Reduced operational costs
  - Instant call pickup
  - Predictable customer experience
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sequential Routing (Team First, AI Backup)">
  **Best for**: Businesses preferring human touch with AI backup

  **Setup**: Ring your personal cell phone for 5-8 seconds, then forward to Recepta AI

  **Benefits**:
  - Option for personal pickup
  - AI handles missed calls
  - No calls go to voicemail
  - Flexible coverage

  <Warning>
  Keep ring times under 10 seconds maximum. Many callers will hang up if they wait too long before reaching someone.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Business Hours Based (Time-Sensitive Routing)">
  **Best for**: Businesses with defined operating hours

  **Setup**: Different routing for business hours vs after-hours

  **Benefits**:
  - Optimize for different times
  - Cost-effective coverage
  - Team handles calls when available
  - AI ensures 24/7 availability
  - Custom holiday routing
</Accordion>

## Important Configuration Tips

### Ring Time Management

<Warning>
**Critical**: Do not allow more than 10 seconds ring time before forwarding to Recepta AI.

Many callers will hang up if they wait too long, defeating the purpose of having AI coverage.
</Warning>

If you choose to ring your personal cell phone before falling back to Recepta AI:

- **Maximum Ring Time**: 5-8 seconds (10 seconds absolute maximum)
- **Sequential Mode**: Ensure phones ring one after another, not simultaneously
- **Caller Experience**: Minimize wait time for better caller retention
- **Test Thoroughly**: Make multiple test calls to verify timing

### Preventing Infinite Call Loops

<Warning>
**Avoid Infinite Loops**: If your Recepta AI agent has you as a transfer destination, the transfer number **must be different** from your main Phone.com number. Otherwise, calls will get stuck in an infinite loop.
</Warning>

**Safe Configuration Example**:
- Main Phone.com Number: Forwards to Recepta AI → ✅ Correct
- AI Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone → ✅ Correct
- ❌ **WRONG**: AI transfers back to main Phone.com number (creates loop)

**Why This Matters**:
If calls forward from Phone.com → Recepta AI → back to Phone.com, they'll loop forever, creating a poor customer experience and potentially incurring charges.
