  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setup Business Hours Routing

To configure time-based call routing in Dialpad:

1. Visit Dialpad's business hours routing guide:
   [Dialpad: Business Hours Call Routing](https://help.dialpad.com/v1/docs/en/manage-a-main-line#business-hours-call-routing)

2. Configure your business hours schedule

3. Set different forwarding destinations for:
   - **During Business Hours**: Your team, with Recepta.ai as overflow
   - **After Hours**: Direct to Recepta.ai
   - **Holidays**: Custom routing for special occasions

<Tip>
Consider using Recepta.ai as your primary after-hours solution to ensure no calls are missed when your team is unavailable.
</Tip>

---

## Overflow Call Handling

If you want to use Recepta.ai as your "overflow" answering service (when your team is busy), configure it as a fallback option in Dialpad.

### Fallback Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Fallback Settings">
    Visit Dialpad's fallback options guide:

    [Dialpad: Fallback Options](https://help.dialpad.com/v1/docs/en/manage-a-main-line#fallback-options)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Overflow Routing">
    Set Recepta.ai as your fallback destination when:
    - All team members are busy
    - Calls aren't answered within a certain time
    - Your queue reaches maximum capacity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Ring Duration">
    Configure how long calls should ring your team before forwarding to Recepta.ai (recommended: 10-15 seconds maximum)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Keep ring times under 15 seconds to prevent caller drop-off. Many callers will hang up if they wait too long.
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration

### Important Setup Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ring Time Limits" icon="clock">
    **Maximum 10 seconds** ring time before forwarding to Recepta.ai

    Longer wait times increase caller drop-off rates significantly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sequential vs Simultaneous" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    **Choose "Sequential" mode** when using team + AI fallback

    Ensures AI only picks up when team doesn't answer.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid Infinite Loops" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Use different numbers** for transfers

    If your agent transfers calls, ensure the transfer destination is your direct line (e.g., cell phone), not your main Dialpad number.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="vial">
    **Make test calls** after configuration

    Verify calls route correctly in all scenarios before going live.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Preventing Call Loops

<Warning>
If your Recepta.ai agent has transfer destinations configured, ensure the transfer number is **different** from your main Dialpad number. Otherwise, you'll create an infinite loop where calls keep getting bounced back and forth.
</Warning>

**Example Safe Configuration**:
- Main Dialpad Number: Forwards to Recepta.ai
- Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone or desk phone

## Testing Your Setup

After configuration, thoroughly test your call forwarding:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test During Business Hours">
    Call your Dialpad number during business hours to verify routing works as expected
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test After Hours">
    Call outside business hours to ensure after-hours routing is configured correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Overflow">
    Have multiple people call simultaneously to test overflow/fallback behavior
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Call Transfers">
    If configured, test that agent transfers work without creating loops
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Call Logs">
    Check both Dialpad and Recepta.ai dashboards to verify calls are logging correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>
