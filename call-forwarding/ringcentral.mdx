## Important Setup Tips

### Ring Time Configuration

<Warning>
**Critical**: Do not allow more than 10 seconds ring time before forwarding to Recepta AI.

Many callers will hang up if they wait too long, defeating the purpose of having AI coverage.
</Warning>

If you choose to ring your personal cell phone before falling back to Recepta AI:

1. **Maximum Ring Time**: 5-8 seconds (10 seconds absolute maximum)
2. **Ring Mode**: Choose "**Sequentially**", NOT "Simultaneously"
3. **Fallback**: Ensure Recepta AI is the fallback destination

### Preventing Infinite Call Loops

<Warning>
**Avoid Infinite Loops**: If your Recepta AI agent has you as a transfer destination, the transfer number **must be different** from your main RingCentral number.
</Warning>

**Safe Configuration Example**:
- Main RingCentral Number: Forwards to Recepta AI → ✅ Correct
- AI Agent Transfer Destination: Your direct cell phone → ✅ Correct
- ❌ **WRONG**: AI transfers back to main RingCentral number (creates loop)

### Sequential vs. Simultaneous Ringing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sequential (Recommended)" icon="1">
    **Use When**: You want team → AI fallback

    Phones ring one after another. AI picks up only if team doesn't answer.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simultaneous" icon="arrows-to-circle">
    **Use When**: You want instant pickup

    All destinations ring at once. First to answer gets the call.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Level Routing

Create sophisticated routing rules:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Primary Reception">
    Ring main reception desk for 5 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Team Queue">
    If unanswered, ring team queue for 5 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Fallback">
    Finally forward to Recepta AI to ensure no calls are missed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Department-Specific Routing

Configure different AI agents for different departments:

<Accordion title="Sales Calls">
  - Forward to sales-optimized AI agent
  - Configure for lead qualification
  - Automatic appointment scheduling
  - CRM integration for lead capture
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Support Calls">
  - Route to support-trained AI agent
  - FAQ knowledge base integration
  - Ticket creation for complex issues
  - Escalation rules for urgent problems
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="General Inquiries">
  - Forward to general-purpose AI agent
  - Company information and directions
  - Department routing
  - Basic question answering
</Accordion>

---

## Testing Your Configuration

Thorough testing ensures your setup works correctly in all scenarios:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test During Business Hours">
    Call during business hours to verify normal routing works
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test After Hours">
    Call outside business hours to confirm after-hours routing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Sequential Fallback">
    If using sequential routing, verify calls properly fall back to AI
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Call Transfers">
    Verify AI agent transfers work without creating loops
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test All Extensions">
    If forwarding multiple extensions, test each one individually
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Call Logs">
    Check logs in both RingCentral and Recepta AI dashboards
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls Not Reaching Recepta AI">
    **Diagnostic Steps**:
    - Verify correct Recepta AI phone number is entered in RingCentral
    - Check that call forwarding is enabled and active
    - Ensure your Recepta AI agent is configured and active
    - Review RingCentral's call flow settings
    - Check for any conflicting routing rules
    - Make test call and review logs in both systems

    **Common Causes**:
    - Typo in Recepta AI phone number
    - Forwarding disabled or expired
    - Conflicting call handling rules
    - AI agent not active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calls Going to Voicemail Instead of AI">
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce ring time before forwarding (max 10 seconds)
    - Ensure Recepta AI is set as forwarding destination
    - Disable or extend voicemail delay
    - Check that forwarding is enabled
    - Verify no conflicting rules override forwarding

    **Best Practice**:
    Set ring time to 5-8 seconds to ensure AI pickup before voicemail
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infinite Call Loops">
    **Solutions**:
    - Use different phone numbers for transfers
    - Never forward RingCentral number to itself
    - Configure AI transfers to direct lines (cell/desk phones)
    - Review complete call flow logic
    - Document your routing to avoid loops

    **Example Safe Setup**:
    ```
    Caller → RingCentral Main → Recepta AI → Transfer to Cell Phone
    (Each step uses a different number)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Business Hours Not Working Correctly">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify business hours schedule is correct
    - Check timezone settings in RingCentral
    - Ensure both business hours and after-hours rules exist
    - Test during transition times (opening/closing)
    - Review holiday calendar settings

    **Tip**:
    Test immediately before/after your business hours transition to catch edge cases
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Only Some Calls Forward to AI">
    **Solutions**:
    - Check if using company-wide vs. extension-specific forwarding
    - Verify all desired extensions have forwarding enabled
    - Review call queue settings
    - Check for department-specific rules
    - Ensure no VIP caller rules override forwarding

    **Note**:
    RingCentral's rules are hierarchical - specific rules can override general ones
