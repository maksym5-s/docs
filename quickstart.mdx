    - **Industry & Services**: What your business offers to customers
    - **Target Audience**: Who your typical customers are

  <Step title="Qualify new clients and customers">
    Configure how your agent handles different caller types:

    - **Potential New Clients**: Questions to qualify leads
    - **Existing Customers**: Information to collect for support
    - **Sales Inquiries**: Lead qualification criteria
    - **General Callers**: Basic information collection

    <Tip>
      Set up qualification questions that help you identify the best prospects and provide appropriate service levels.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload knowledge base">
    Enhance your agent with additional business knowledge:

    - **Business Documents**: Upload manuals, guides, policies
