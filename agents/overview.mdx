## How AI Voice Agents Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call Reception">
    When a customer calls your business number, the AI agent answers immediately with a personalized greeting based on your configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intent Recognition">
    The agent uses natural language understanding to identify what the caller needs - whether it's information, support, or a specific service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    Based on your business knowledge and trained responses, the agent provides accurate, helpful information in a natural conversational flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action Execution">
    The agent can perform actions like scheduling appointments, taking messages, transferring calls, or collecting contact information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human Handoff">
    When the AI agent encounters complex situations beyond its capabilities, it can seamlessly transfer the call to a human agent for personalized assistance.
  </Step>
</Steps>
